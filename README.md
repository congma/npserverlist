##SYNOPSIS

    npserverlist.py ZONE-NAME


##DESCRIPTION

The zone-name is either the name of a continent (such as "asia" or
"north-america"), or a two-letter country code (such as "uk", "fr", or "jp").
An unrecognized zone-name will either be rejected before querying the web
source, or result in an error after querying the web source and failing.

Error messages, if any, are written to the standard error.

  /etc/ntp.conf`:  Create `/etc/ntp.conf` (or `/etc/chrony.conf`) from a
  template file `ntp-boilerplate`, adding `iburst` option to the `server`
